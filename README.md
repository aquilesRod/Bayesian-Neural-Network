# Bayesian-Neural-Network

### This .ipynb file focuses on the generation of a Bayesian network applied to assess the likelihood of a variable being influenced by others within a pre-processed dataset. The notebook delves into the intricacies of Bayesian network construction, aiming to model relationships and dependencies between variables. The dataset has undergone a preprocessing phase to ensure data quality and relevance. Through this notebook, users can explore the application of Bayesian networks as a powerful tool for probabilistic reasoning, especially in understanding the conditional dependencies between variables and making informed predictions based on the pre-processed data.
